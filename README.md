> NASA INTERNATIONAL SPACE APPS CHALLENGE (Learning Through the Looking Glass)


## HIGH-LEVEL PROJECT SUMMARY
We developed an online game that explains the functionalities of the James Webb Space Telescope components in a very fun way. The player goes on a quest to build their very own James Webb Space Telescope. Consisting of an introduction, four different and unique chapters that the user will explore in order to have a clearer understanding of the telescope, and finally a gallery to dive deeper into the universe. The JWST is a groundbreaking technology, we need to understand its work in order for us to understand our world, and to understand the universe.
